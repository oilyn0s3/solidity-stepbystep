contract Intro {

    /* 
    Alright, If you were anything like me (if you were starting out in solidity and blockchain etc.), 
    and looked at some solidity code the very fisrt thing that must have popped up in your mind would be 
    - What the heck is a "contract" ?
        It is a fundamental building block of the Ethereum applications and all variables and functions 
        beling to a contract.
        Well a contract is sort of like a class, which has it's own set of functions and variables.
        We refer them in such a way because, it is like a promise - an unbreakable promise - that 
        resides on ethereum blockchain. Some times it can be referd as an "smart contract" it kind means the same 
        i.e. a contract capable of running when some condition is met.
    - Why do we need solidity?
        Solidity is a high level, obejct oriented language used for creating smart contracts.
        It's an special purpose programming language which is capable of running on EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine).
